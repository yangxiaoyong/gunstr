<p><tt>What are these zombie processes that show up in ps?&nbsp; I
kill them but they don't go away!</tt></p>

<p>Zombies are dead processes.&nbsp; You cannot kill the dead.&nbsp;
All processes eventually die, and when they do they become
zombies.&nbsp; They consume almost no resources, which is to be
expected because they are dead!&nbsp; The reason for zombies is so the
zombie's parent (process) can retrieve the zombie's exit status and
resource usage statistics.&nbsp; The parent signals the operating
system that it no longer needs the zombie by using one of the
<tt>wait()</tt> system calls.</p>

<p>When a process dies, its child processes all become children of
process number 1, which is the init process.&nbsp; Init is ``always''
waiting for children to die, so that they don't remain as zombies.</p>

<p>If you have zombie processes it means those zombies have not been
waited for by their parent (look at PPID displayed by
<tt>ps&nbsp;-l</tt>).&nbsp; You have three choices: Fix the parent
process (make it wait); kill the parent; or live with it.&nbsp;
Remember that living with it is not so hard because zombies take up
little more than one extra line in the output of <tt>ps</tt>.</p>
