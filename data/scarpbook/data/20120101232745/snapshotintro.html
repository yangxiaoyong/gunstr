Snapshots</h1><p>
        A wonderful facility provided by LVM is 'snapshots'.  This
        allows the administrator to create a new block device which
        presents an exact copy of a logical volume, frozen at some
        point in time.  Typically this would be used when some batch
        processing, a backup for instance, needs to be performed on
        the logical volume, but you don't want to halt a live system
        that is changing the data.  When the snapshot device has been
        finished with the system administrator can just remove the
        device.  This facility does require that the snapshot be made
        at a time when the data on the logical volume is in a
        consistent state - the VFS-lock patch for LVM1 makes sure that
        some filesystems do this automatically when a snapshot is
        created, and many of the filesystems in the 2.6 kernel do this
        automatically when a snapshot is created without patching.

          If the snapshot logical volume becomes full it will be dropped
          (become unusable) so it is vitally important to allocate enough space.
          The amount of space necessary is dependent on the usage of the
          snapshot, so there is no set recipe to follow for this. If the
          snapshot size equals the origin size, it will never overflow.

        LVM1 has read-only snapshots.  Read-only snapshots work by
        creating an <em>exception table</em>, which is
        used to keep track of which blocks have been changed.  If a
        block is to be changed on the origin, it is first copied to
        the snapshot, marked as copied in the exception table, and
        then the new data is written to the original volume.
      </p><p>
        In LVM2, snapshots are read/write by default.  Read/write
        snapshots work like read-only snapshots, with the additional
        feature that if data is written to the snapshot, that block is
        marked in the exception table as used, and never gets copied
        from the original volume.  This opens up many new
        possibilities that were not possible with LVM1's read-only
        snapshots.  One example is to snapshot a volume, mount the
        snapshot, and try an experimental program that change files on
        that volume.  If you don't like what it did, you can unmount
        the snapshot, remove it, and mount the original filesystem in
        its place.  It is also useful for creating volumes for use
        with <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/" target="_top">Xen</a>.
        You can create a disk image, then snapshot it and modify the
        snapshot for a particular domU instance.  You can then create
        another snapshot of the original volume, and modify that one
        for a different domU instance.  Since the only storage used by
        a snapshot is blocks that were changed on the origin or the
        snapshot, the majority of the volume is shared by the domU's.
