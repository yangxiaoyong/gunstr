Benefits of Logical Volume Management on a Small System</h1><p>
        One of the difficult decisions facing a new user installing Linux
        for the first time is how to partition the disk drive. The need to
        estimate just how much space is likely to be needed for system
        files and user files makes the installation more complex than is
        necessary and some users simply opt to put all their data into one
        large partition in an attempt to avoid the issue.
      </p><p>
        Once the user has guessed how much space is needed for /home /usr /
        (or has let the installation program do it) then is quite common
        for one of these partitions to fill up even if there is plenty of
        disk space in one of the other partitions.
      </p><p>
        With logical volume management, the whole disk would be allocated
        to a single volume group and logical volumes created to hold the /
        /usr and /home file systems. If, for example the /home logical
        volume later filled up but there was still space available on /usr
        then it would be possible to shrink /usr by a few megabytes and
        reallocate that space to /home.
      </p><p>
        Another alternative would be to allocate minimal amounts of space
        for each logical volume and leave some of the disk unallocated.
        Then, when the partitions start to fill up, they can be expanded as
        necessary.
      </p><p>
        As an example:
        
        Joe buys a PC with an 8.4 Gigabyte disk on it and installs Linux
        using the following partitioning system:
        <table bgcolor="#E0E0E0" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre class="screen">/boot    /dev/hda1     10 Megabytes
swap     /dev/hda2    256 Megabytes
/        /dev/hda3      2 Gigabytes
/home    /dev/hda4      6 Gigabytes
        </pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table>
        This, he thinks, will maximize the amount of space available for all his MP3
        files.
      </p><p>
        Sometime later Joe decides that he want to install the latest
        office suite and desktop UI available but realizes that the root
        partition isn't large enough.  But, having archived all his MP3s
        onto a new writable DVD drive there is plenty of space on /home.
      </p><p>
        His options are not good:
      </p><p></p><ol type="1"><li><p>
            Reformat the disk, change the partitioning scheme and
            reinstall.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Buy a new disk and figure out some new partitioning scheme
            that will require the minimum of data movement.
          </p></li><li><p>
            Set up a symlink farm on / pointing to /home and install the new
            software on /home
          </p></li></ol><p>
        With LVM this becomes much easier:
      </p><p>
        Jane buys a similar PC but uses LVM to divide up the disk in a similar
        manner:
      </p><table bgcolor="#E0E0E0" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre class="screen">/boot     /dev/hda1        10 Megabytes
swap      /dev/vg00/swap   256 Megabytes
/         /dev/vg00/root     2 Gigabytes
/home     /dev/vg00/home     6 Gigabytes

         </pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="note"><p></p><table class="note" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="TOP" width="25"><img src="note.gif" alt="Note" hspace="5"></td><td align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><p>
          boot is not included on the LV because bootloaders don't
          understand LVM volumes yet.  It's possible boot on LVM will
          work, but you run the risk of having an unbootable system.
        </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="warning"><p></p><table class="warning" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td align="CENTER" valign="TOP" width="25"><img src="warning.gif" alt="Warning" hspace="5"></td><th align="LEFT" valign="CENTER"><b>root on LV should be used by advanced users only</b></th></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><p>
          root on LVM requires an initrd image that activates the root
          LV.  If a kernel is upgraded without building the necessary
          initrd image, that kernel will be unbootable.  Newer
          distributions support lvm in their mkinitrd scripts as well
          as their packaged initrd images, so this becomes less of an
          issue over time.
        </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
        When she hits a similar problem she can reduce the size of /home by
        a gigabyte and add that space to the root partition.
      </p><p>
        Suppose that Joe and Jane then manage to fill up the /home
        partition as well and decide to add a new 20 Gigabyte disk to their
        systems.
      </p><p>
        Joe formats the whole disk as one partition (/dev/hdb1) and moves
        his existing /home data onto it and uses the new disk as /home. But
        he has 6 gigabytes unused or has to use symlinks to make that disk
        appear as an extension of /home, say /home/joe/old-mp3s.
      </p><p>
        Jane simply adds the new disk to her existing volume group and
        extends her /home logical volume to include the new disk. Or, in
        fact, she could move the data from /home on the old disk to the new
        disk and then extend the existing root volume to cover all of the
        old disk.
