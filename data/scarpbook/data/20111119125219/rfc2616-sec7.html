<h2><a id="sec7">7</a> Entity</h2>
<p>
   Request and Response messages MAY transfer an entity if not otherwise
   restricted by the request method or response status code. An entity
   consists of entity-header fields and an entity-body, although some
   responses will only include the entity-headers.
</p>
<p>
   In this section, both sender and recipient refer to either the client
   or the server, depending on who sends and who receives the entity.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec7.1">7.1</a> Entity Header Fields</h3>
<p>
   Entity-header fields define metainformation about the entity-body or,
   if no body is present, about the resource identified by the request.
   Some of this metainformation is OPTIONAL; some might be REQUIRED by
   portions of this specification.
</p>
<pre>       entity-header  = Allow                    ; Section 14.7

                      | extension-header
</pre>
<pre>       extension-header = message-header
</pre>
<p>
   The extension-header mechanism allows additional entity-header fields
   to be defined without changing the protocol, but these fields cannot
   be assumed to be recognizable by the recipient. Unrecognized header
   fields SHOULD be ignored by the recipient and MUST be forwarded by
   transparent proxies.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec7.2">7.2</a> Entity Body</h3>
<p>
   The entity-body (if any) sent with an HTTP request or response is in
   a format and encoding defined by the entity-header fields.
</p>
<pre>       entity-body    = *OCTET
</pre>
<p>
   An entity-body is only present in a message when a message-body is
   present, as described in section 4.3. The entity-body is obtained
   from the message-body by decoding any Transfer-Encoding that might
   have been applied to ensure safe and proper transfer of the message.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec7.2.1">7.2.1</a> Type</h3>
<p>
   When an entity-body is included with a message, the data type of that
   body is determined via the header fields Content-Type and Content-
   Encoding. These define a two-layer, ordered encoding model:
</p>
<pre>       entity-body := Content-Encoding( Content-Type( data ) )
</pre>
<p>
   Content-Type specifies the media type of the underlying data.
   Content-Encoding may be used to indicate any additional content
   codings applied to the data, usually for the purpose of data
   compression, that are a property of the requested resource. There is
   no default encoding.
</p>
<p>
   Any HTTP/1.1 message containing an entity-body SHOULD include a
   Content-Type header field defining the media type of that body. If
   and only if the media type is not given by a Content-Type field, the
   recipient MAY attempt to guess the media type via inspection of its
   content and/or the name extension(s) of the URI used to identify the
   resource. If the media type remains unknown, the recipient SHOULD
   treat it as type "application/octet-stream".
</p>
<h3><a id="sec7.2.2">7.2.2</a> Entity Length</h3>
<p>
   The entity-length of a message is the length of the message-body
   before any transfer-codings have been applied. Section 4.4 defines
   how the transfer-length of a message-body is determined.
</p>
