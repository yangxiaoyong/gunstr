<h2><a id="sec8">8</a> Connections</h2>
<h3><a id="sec8.1">8.1</a> Persistent Connections</h3>
<h3><a id="sec8.1.1">8.1.1</a> Purpose</h3>
<p>
   Prior to persistent connections, a separate TCP connection was
   established to fetch each URL, increasing the load on HTTP servers
   and causing congestion on the Internet. The use of inline images and
   other associated data often require a client to make multiple
   requests of the same server in a short amount of time. Analysis of
   these performance problems and results from a prototype
   implementation are available <a indepth="true" rel="bibref" href="rfc2616-sec17.html#bib26">[26]</a> <a indepth="true" rel="bibref" href="rfc2616-sec17.html#bib30">[30]</a>. Implementation experience and
   measurements of actual HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2068) implementations show good
   results <a indepth="true" rel="bibref" href="rfc2616-sec17.html#bib39">[39]</a>. Alternatives have also been explored, for example,
   T/TCP <a indepth="true" rel="bibref" href="rfc2616-sec17.html#bib27">[27]</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Persistent HTTP connections have a number of advantages:
</p>
<pre>      - By opening and closing fewer TCP connections, CPU time is saved
        in routers and hosts (clients, servers, proxies, gateways,
        tunnels, or caches), and memory used for TCP protocol control
        blocks can be saved in hosts.
</pre>
<pre>      - HTTP requests and responses can be pipelined on a connection.
        Pipelining allows a client to make multiple requests without
        waiting for each response, allowing a single TCP connection to
        be used much more efficiently, with much lower elapsed time.
</pre>
<pre>      - Network congestion is reduced by reducing the number of packets
        caused by TCP opens, and by allowing TCP sufficient time to
        determine the congestion state of the network.
</pre>
<pre>      - Latency on subsequent requests is reduced since there is no time
        spent in TCP's connection opening handshake.
</pre>
<pre>      - HTTP can evolve more gracefully, since errors can be reported
        without the penalty of closing the TCP connection. Clients using
        future versions of HTTP might optimistically try a new feature,
        but if communicating with an older server, retry with old
        semantics after an error is reported.
</pre>
<p>
   HTTP implementations SHOULD implement persistent connections.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec8.1.2">8.1.2</a> Overall Operation</h3>
<p>
   A significant difference between HTTP/1.1 and earlier versions of
   HTTP is that persistent connections are the default behavior of any
   HTTP connection. That is, unless otherwise indicated, the client
   SHOULD assume that the server will maintain a persistent connection,
   even after error responses from the server.
</p>
<p>
   Persistent connections provide a mechanism by which a client and a
   server can signal the close of a TCP connection. This signaling takes
   place using the Connection header field (section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.10">14.10</a>). Once a close
   has been signaled, the client MUST NOT send any more requests on that
   connection.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec8.1.2.1">8.1.2.1</a> Negotiation</h3>
<p>
   An HTTP/1.1 server MAY assume that a HTTP/1.1 client intends to
   maintain a persistent connection unless a Connection header including
   the connection-token "close" was sent in the request. If the server
   chooses to close the connection immediately after sending the
   response, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the
   connection-token close.
</p>
<p>
   An HTTP/1.1 client MAY expect a connection to remain open, but would
   decide to keep it open based on whether the response from a server
   contains a Connection header with the connection-token close. In case
   the client does not want to maintain a connection for more than that
   request, it SHOULD send a Connection header including the
   connection-token close.
</p>
<p>
   If either the client or the server sends the close token in the
   Connection header, that request becomes the last one for the
   connection.
</p>
<p>
   Clients and servers SHOULD NOT assume that a persistent connection is
   maintained for HTTP versions less than 1.1 unless it is explicitly
   signaled. See section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.6.2">19.6.2</a> for more information on backward
   compatibility with HTTP/1.0 clients.
</p>
<p>
   In order to remain persistent, all messages on the connection MUST
   have a self-defined message length (i.e., one not defined by closure
   of the connection), as described in section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.4">4.4</a>.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec8.1.2.2">8.1.2.2</a> Pipelining</h3>
<p>
   A client that supports persistent connections MAY "pipeline" its
   requests (i.e., send multiple requests without waiting for each
   response). A server MUST send its responses to those requests in the
   same order that the requests were received.
</p>
<p>
   Clients which assume persistent connections and pipeline immediately
   after connection establishment SHOULD be prepared to retry their
   connection if the first pipelined attempt fails. If a client does
   such a retry, it MUST NOT pipeline before it knows the connection is
   persistent. Clients MUST also be prepared to resend their requests if
   the server closes the connection before sending all of the
   corresponding responses.
</p>
<p>
   Clients SHOULD NOT pipeline requests using non-idempotent methods or
   non-idempotent sequences of methods (see section 9.1.2). Otherwise, a
   premature termination of the transport connection could lead to
   indeterminate results. A client wishing to send a non-idempotent
   request SHOULD wait to send that request until it has received the
   response status for the previous request.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec8.1.3">8.1.3</a> Proxy Servers</h3>
<p>
   It is especially important that proxies correctly implement the
   properties of the Connection header field as specified in section
   <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.10">14.10</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The proxy server MUST signal persistent connections separately with
   its clients and the origin servers (or other proxy servers) that it
   connects to. Each persistent connection applies to only one transport
   link.
</p>
<p>
   A proxy server MUST NOT establish a HTTP/1.1 persistent connection
   with an HTTP/1.0 client (but see RFC 2068 [33] for information and
   discussion of the problems with the Keep-Alive header implemented by
   many HTTP/1.0 clients).
</p>
<h3><a id="sec8.1.4">8.1.4</a> Practical Considerations</h3>
<p>
   Servers will usually have some time-out value beyond which they will
   no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make
   this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making
   more connections through the same server. The use of persistent
   connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of
   this time-out for either the client or the server.
</p>
<p>
   When a client or server wishes to time-out it SHOULD issue a graceful
   close on the transport connection. Clients and servers SHOULD both
   constantly watch for the other side of the transport close, and
   respond to it as appropriate. If a client or server does not detect
   the other side's close promptly it could cause unnecessary resource
   drain on the network.
</p>
<p>
   A client, server, or proxy MAY close the transport connection at any
   time. For example, a client might have started to send a new request
   at the same time that the server has decided to close the "idle"
   connection. From the server's point of view, the connection is being
   closed while it was idle, but from the client's point of view, a
   request is in progress.
</p>
<p>
   This means that clients, servers, and proxies MUST be able to recover
   from asynchronous close events. Client software SHOULD reopen the
   transport connection and retransmit the aborted sequence of requests
   without user interaction so long as the request sequence is
   idempotent (see section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.2">9.1.2</a>). Non-idempotent methods or sequences
   MUST NOT be automatically retried, although user agents MAY offer a
   human operator the choice of retrying the request(s). Confirmation by
   user-agent software with semantic understanding of the application
   MAY substitute for user confirmation. The automatic retry SHOULD NOT
   be repeated if the second sequence of requests fails.
</p>
<p>
   Servers SHOULD always respond to at least one request per connection,
   if at all possible. Servers SHOULD NOT close a connection in the
   middle of transmitting a response, unless a network or client failure
   is suspected.
</p>
<p>
   Clients that use persistent connections SHOULD limit the number of
   simultaneous connections that they maintain to a given server. A
   single-user client SHOULD NOT maintain more than 2 connections with
   any server or proxy. A proxy SHOULD use up to 2*N connections to
   another server or proxy, where N is the number of simultaneously
   active users. These guidelines are intended to improve HTTP response
   times and avoid congestion.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec8.2">8.2</a> Message Transmission Requirements</h3>
<h3><a id="sec8.2.1">8.2.1</a> Persistent Connections and Flow Control</h3>
<p>
   HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD maintain persistent connections and use TCP's
   flow control mechanisms to resolve temporary overloads, rather than
   terminating connections with the expectation that clients will retry.
   The latter technique can exacerbate network congestion.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec8.2.2">8.2.2</a> Monitoring Connections for Error Status Messages</h3>
<p>
   An HTTP/1.1 (or later) client sending a message-body SHOULD monitor
   the network connection for an error status while it is transmitting
   the request. If the client sees an error status, it SHOULD
   immediately cease transmitting the body. If the body is being sent
   using a "chunked" encoding (section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.6">3.6</a>), a zero length chunk and
   empty trailer MAY be used to prematurely mark the end of the message.
   If the body was preceded by a Content-Length header, the client MUST
   close the connection.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec8.2.3">8.2.3</a> Use of the 100 (Continue) Status</h3>
<p>
   The purpose of the 100 (Continue) status (see section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.1.1">10.1.1</a>) is to
   allow a client that is sending a request message with a request body
   to determine if the origin server is willing to accept the request
   (based on the request headers) before the client sends the request
   body. In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly
   inefficient for the client to send the body if the server will reject
   the message without looking at the body.
</p>
<p>
   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 clients:
</p>
<pre>      - If a client will wait for a 100 (Continue) response before
        sending the request body, it MUST send an Expect request-header
        field (section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.20">14.20</a>) with the "100-continue" expectation.
</pre>
<pre>      - A client MUST NOT send an Expect request-header field (section
        <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.20">14.20</a>) with the "100-continue" expectation if it does not intend
        to send a request body.
</pre>
<p>
   Because of the presence of older implementations, the protocol allows
   ambiguous situations in which a client may send "Expect: 100-
   continue" without receiving either a 417 (Expectation Failed) status
   or a 100 (Continue) status. Therefore, when a client sends this
   header field to an origin server (possibly via a proxy) from which it
   has never seen a 100 (Continue) status, the client SHOULD NOT wait
   for an indefinite period before sending the request body.
</p>
<p>
   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 origin servers:
</p>
<pre>      - Upon receiving a request which includes an Expect request-header
        field with the "100-continue" expectation, an origin server MUST
        either respond with 100 (Continue) status and continue to read
        from the input stream, or respond with a final status code. The
        origin server MUST NOT wait for the request body before sending
        the 100 (Continue) response. If it responds with a final status
        code, it MAY close the transport connection or it MAY continue
</pre>
<pre>        to read and discard the rest of the request.  It MUST NOT
        perform the requested method if it returns a final status code.
</pre>
<pre>      - An origin server SHOULD NOT send a 100 (Continue) response if
        the request message does not include an Expect request-header
        field with the "100-continue" expectation, and MUST NOT send a
        100 (Continue) response if such a request comes from an HTTP/1.0
        (or earlier) client. There is an exception to this rule: for
        compatibility with RFC 2068, a server MAY send a 100 (Continue)
        status in response to an HTTP/1.1 PUT or POST request that does
        not include an Expect request-header field with the "100-
        continue" expectation. This exception, the purpose of which is
        to minimize any client processing delays associated with an
        undeclared wait for 100 (Continue) status, applies only to
        HTTP/1.1 requests, and not to requests with any other HTTP-
        version value.
</pre>
<pre>      - An origin server MAY omit a 100 (Continue) response if it has
        already received some or all of the request body for the
        corresponding request.
</pre>
<pre>      - An origin server that sends a 100 (Continue) response MUST
        ultimately send a final status code, once the request body is
        received and processed, unless it terminates the transport
        connection prematurely.
</pre>
<pre>      - If an origin server receives a request that does not include an
        Expect request-header field with the "100-continue" expectation,
        the request includes a request body, and the server responds
        with a final status code before reading the entire request body
        from the transport connection, then the server SHOULD NOT close
        the transport connection until it has read the entire request,
        or until the client closes the connection. Otherwise, the client
        might not reliably receive the response message. However, this
        requirement is not be construed as preventing a server from
        defending itself against denial-of-service attacks, or from
        badly broken client implementations.
</pre>
<p>
   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 proxies:
</p>
<pre>      - If a proxy receives a request that includes an Expect request-
        header field with the "100-continue" expectation, and the proxy
        either knows that the next-hop server complies with HTTP/1.1 or
        higher, or does not know the HTTP version of the next-hop
        server, it MUST forward the request, including the Expect header
        field.
</pre>
<pre>      - If the proxy knows that the version of the next-hop server is
        HTTP/1.0 or lower, it MUST NOT forward the request, and it MUST
        respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.
</pre>
<pre>      - Proxies SHOULD maintain a cache recording the HTTP version
        numbers received from recently-referenced next-hop servers.
</pre>
<pre>      - A proxy MUST NOT forward a 100 (Continue) response if the
        request message was received from an HTTP/1.0 (or earlier)
        client and did not include an Expect request-header field with
        the "100-continue" expectation. This requirement overrides the
        general rule for forwarding of 1xx responses (see section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.1">10.1</a>).
</pre>
<h3><a id="sec8.2.4">8.2.4</a> Client Behavior if Server Prematurely Closes Connection</h3>
<p>
   If an HTTP/1.1 client sends a request which includes a request body,
   but which does not include an Expect request-header field with the
   "100-continue" expectation, and if the client is not directly
   connected to an HTTP/1.1 origin server, and if the client sees the
   connection close before receiving any status from the server, the
   client SHOULD retry the request.  If the client does retry this
   request, it MAY use the following "binary exponential backoff"
   algorithm to be assured of obtaining a reliable response:
</p>
<pre>      1. Initiate a new connection to the server
</pre>
<pre>      2. Transmit the request-headers
</pre>
<pre>      3. Initialize a variable R to the estimated round-trip time to the
         server (e.g., based on the time it took to establish the
         connection), or to a constant value of 5 seconds if the round-
         trip time is not available.
</pre>
<pre>      4. Compute T = R * (2**N), where N is the number of previous
         retries of this request.
</pre>
<pre>      5. Wait either for an error response from the server, or for T
         seconds (whichever comes first)
</pre>
<pre>      6. If no error response is received, after T seconds transmit the
         body of the request.
</pre>
<pre>      7. If client sees that the connection is closed prematurely,
         repeat from step 1 until the request is accepted, an error
         response is received, or the user becomes impatient and
         terminates the retry process.
</pre>
<p>
   If at any point an error status is received, the client
</p>
<pre>      - SHOULD NOT continue and
</pre>
<pre>      - SHOULD close the connection if it has not completed sending the
        request message.
</pre>
