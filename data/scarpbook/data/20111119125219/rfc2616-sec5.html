<h2><a id="sec5">5</a> Request</h2>
<p>
   A request message from a client to a server includes, within the
   first line of that message, the method to be applied to the resource,
   the identifier of the resource, and the protocol version in use.
</p>
<pre>        Request       = Request-Line              ; Section 5.1
                        *(( general-header        ; Section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.5">4.5</a>

                        [ message-body ]          ; Section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.3">4.3</a>
</pre>
<h3><a id="sec5.1">5.1</a> Request-Line</h3>
<p>
   The Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the
   Request-URI and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The
   elements are separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed
   except in the final CRLF sequence.
</p>
<pre>        Request-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
</pre>
<h3><a id="sec5.1.1">5.1.1</a> Method</h3>
<p>
   The Method  token indicates the method to be performed on the
   resource identified by the Request-URI. The method is case-sensitive.
</p>
<pre>       Method         = "OPTIONS"                ; Section 9.2
                      | "GET"                    ; Section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.3">9.3</a>

       extension-method = token
</pre>
<p>
   The list of methods allowed by a resource can be specified in an
   Allow header field (section 14.7). The return code of the response
   always notifies the client whether a method is currently allowed on a
   resource, since the set of allowed methods can change dynamically. An
   origin server SHOULD return the status code 405 (Method Not Allowed)
   if the method is known by the origin server but not allowed for the
   requested resource, and 501 (Not Implemented) if the method is
   unrecognized or not implemented by the origin server. The methods GET
   and HEAD MUST be supported by all general-purpose servers. All other
   methods are OPTIONAL; however, if the above methods are implemented,
   they MUST be implemented with the same semantics as those specified
   in section 9.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec5.1.2">5.1.2</a> Request-URI</h3>
<p>
   The Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier (section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.2">3.2</a>) and
   identifies the resource upon which to apply the request.
</p>
<pre>       Request-URI    = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority
</pre>
<p>
   The four options for Request-URI are dependent on the nature of the
   request. The asterisk "*" means that the request does not apply to a
   particular resource, but to the server itself, and is only allowed
   when the method used does not necessarily apply to a resource. One
   example would be
</p>
<pre>       OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
</pre>
<p>
   The absoluteURI form is REQUIRED when the request is being made to a
   proxy. The proxy is requested to forward the request or service it
   from a valid cache, and return the response. Note that the proxy MAY
   forward the request on to another proxy or directly to the server
</p>
<p>
   specified by the absoluteURI. In order to avoid request loops, a
   proxy MUST be able to recognize all of its server names, including
   any aliases, local variations, and the numeric IP address. An example
   Request-Line would be:
</p>
<pre>       GET http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
</pre>
<p>
   To allow for transition to absoluteURIs in all requests in future
   versions of HTTP, all HTTP/1.1 servers MUST accept the absoluteURI
   form in requests, even though HTTP/1.1 clients will only generate
   them in requests to proxies.
</p>
<p>
   The authority form is only used by the CONNECT method (section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.9">9.9</a>).
</p>
<p>
   The most common form of Request-URI is that used to identify a
   resource on an origin server or gateway. In this case the absolute
   path of the URI MUST be transmitted (see section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.2.1">3.2.1</a>, abs_path) as
   the Request-URI, and the network location of the URI (authority) MUST
   be transmitted in a Host header field. For example, a client wishing
   to retrieve the resource above directly from the origin server would
   create a TCP connection to port 80 of the host "www.w3.org" and send
   the lines:
</p>
<pre>       GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
       Host: www.w3.org
</pre>
<p>
   followed by the remainder of the Request. Note that the absolute path
   cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it MUST be
   given as "/" (the server root).
</p>
<p>
   The Request-URI is transmitted in the format specified in section
   3.2.1. If the Request-URI is encoded using the "% HEX HEX" encoding
   <a indepth="true" rel="bibref" href="rfc2616-sec17.html#bib42">[42]</a>, the origin server MUST decode the Request-URI in order to
   properly interpret the request. Servers SHOULD respond to invalid
   Request-URIs with an appropriate status code.
</p>
<p>
   A transparent proxy MUST NOT rewrite the "abs_path" part of the
   received Request-URI when forwarding it to the next inbound server,
   except as noted above to replace a null abs_path with "/".
</p>
<pre>      Note: The "no rewrite" rule prevents the proxy from changing the
      meaning of the request when the origin server is improperly using
      a non-reserved URI character for a reserved purpose.  Implementors
      should be aware that some pre-HTTP/1.1 proxies have been known to
      rewrite the Request-URI.
</pre>
<h3><a id="sec5.2">5.2</a> The Resource Identified by a Request</h3>
<p>
   The exact resource identified by an Internet request is determined by
   examining both the Request-URI and the Host header field.
</p>
<p>
   An origin server that does not allow resources to differ by the
   requested host MAY ignore the Host header field value when
   determining the resource identified by an HTTP/1.1 request. (But see
   section <a indepth="true" rel="xref" href="rfc2616-sec19.html#sec19.6.1.1">19.6.1.1</a> for other requirements on Host support in HTTP/1.1.)
</p>
<p>
   An origin server that does differentiate resources based on the host
   requested (sometimes referred to as virtual hosts or vanity host
   names) MUST use the following rules for determining the requested
   resource on an HTTP/1.1 request:
</p>
<p>
   1. If Request-URI is an absoluteURI, the host is part of the
     Request-URI. Any Host header field value in the request MUST be
     ignored.
</p>
<p>
   2. If the Request-URI is not an absoluteURI, and the request includes
     a Host header field, the host is determined by the Host header
     field value.
</p>
<p>
   3. If the host as determined by rule 1 or 2 is not a valid host on
     the server, the response MUST be a 400 (Bad Request) error message.
</p>
<p>
   Recipients of an HTTP/1.0 request that lacks a Host header field MAY
   attempt to use heuristics (e.g., examination of the URI path for
   something unique to a particular host) in order to determine what
   exact resource is being requested.
</p>
<h3><a id="sec5.3">5.3</a> Request Header Fields</h3>
<p>
   The request-header fields allow the client to pass additional
   information about the request, and about the client itself, to the
   server. These fields act as request modifiers, with semantics
   equivalent to the parameters on a programming language method
   invocation.

</pre>
<p>
   Request-header field names can be extended reliably only in
   combination with a change in the protocol version. However, new or
   experimental header fields MAY be given the semantics of request-
   header fields if all parties in the communication recognize them to
   be request-header fields. Unrecognized header fields are treated as
   entity-header fields.
